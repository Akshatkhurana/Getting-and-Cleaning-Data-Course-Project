# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project
This repository contains the code and data for the Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project, a Coursera course offered by Johns Hopkins University. The purpose of the project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. :)
